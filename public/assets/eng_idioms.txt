he can who believes he can
he can’t win
he doesn’t miss a trick
he gives twice who gives quickly
he had better keep quiet about it
he had to draw a line somewhere
he has a bright future
he has been and done
he has made his bed
he hill
he is a regular trojan
he is going to kill
he is going to murder
he is not going to bite
he is not going to eat
he laughs best who laughs last
he laughs longest who laughs last
he laughs loudest who laughs last
he lives long who lives well
he looks a little peaked
he looks like a million
he made my day
he might be forgiven for
he needs to get our more
he or she
he puts his pants on one leg at a time
he puts his trousers on one leg at a time
he saved the day
he started it
he stoops to conquer

he that is down need fear no fall
he that lieth with dogs riseth with fleas
he that would eat the fruit must climb the tree
he that would eat the kernel must crack the nut
he that would go to sea for pleasure would go to hell for a pastime
he that would have eggs must endure the cackling of hens
he that would the daughter win must with the mother first begin
he travels fastest who travels alone
he who begins many things finishes but few
he who excuses himself accuses himself
he who fails to prepare prepares to fail
he who fights and runs away may live to fight another day
he who gives fair words feeds you with an empty spoon
he who hesitates
he who laughs last laughs best
he who laughs last laughs longest
he who lives by the sword dies by the sword
he who pays the piper calls the tune
he who plays with fire gets burnt
he who rides a tiger is afraid to dismount
he who sleeps forgets his hunger
he who smelt it dealt it
he who sups with the devil should have a long spoon
he who would climb the ladder must begin at the bottom
he will be forgiven for
he will kill
he will murder
he would be forgiven for
he would be lucky

isle of man
isle of wight
isn’t having any of it
issue from some place
it all boils down to
it all comes out in the wash
it all depends
it all together
it always pays
it appears to me
it beats me
it blows my mind
it cost an arm and a leg
it cost the earth
it could happen to a bishop
it cuts both ways
it cuts two ways
it dawned on sb
it do not make me no never mind
it does exactly what it says on the tin
it does heart good
it does no harm
it does what it says on the tin
it doesn’t grow on trees
it escapes
it figures
it gave me life
it goes to show
it goes with the territory
it goes without saying
it happens
it has your name on it
it is a long lane that has no turning
it is a long story
it is a matter of
it is a poor heart that never rejoices
it is a question of
it is a sad heart that never rejoices
it is a wise child that knows its own father
it is a wrap
it is all downhill
it is all over for
it is all over with her
it is all over with one
it is all up with
it is an ill wind that blows nobody good
it is better to be born lucky than rich
it is better to give than to receive
it is better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all
it is better to travel hopefully than to arrive
it is better to wear out than to rust out
it is business as usual
it is dogged that does it
it is easier to tear down than to build up
it is easy to be wise after the event
it is easy to find a stick to beat a dog
it is high time
it is just as well
it is just one of those things
it is meat and drink to me
it is more blessed to give than to receive
it is never too late
it is nice to meet you
it is nice to see you
it is no crime
it is no picnic
it is not over til it is over
it is not saying much
it is not worth it
it is not worth the trouble
it is nothing
it is six and two threes
it is the berries
it is the pace that kills
it is tipping down
it is tipping it down
it is to die
it is to laugh
it is touch and go
it is what it is
it is written all over face
it is you
it isn’t his thing
it isn’t my thing
it isn’t on
it makes no difference
it makes no odds
it me
it never fails
it never pays
it never rains but it pours
it occurs to me
it pays to
it phased me out
it remains to be seen
it says a lot about
it says a lot for
it says very little for
it seems to me
it serves right
it sounds like a plan
it speaks well for
it stands to reason
it strikes me
it sucks
it takes a thief to catch a thief
it takes a village
it takes all sorts
it takes getting used to
it takes money to make money
it takes one bad apple to spoil the bunch
it takes one to know one
it takes two
it was a lark
it was ever so
it was ever thus
it was fun while it lasted
it was greek to me
it was nice to see you
it was nothing
it was tipping down
it was tipping it down
it will all come out in the wash
it will be a cold day in hell
it will be ass
it will come out in the wash
it will cost her
it will cost you
it will never do
it will never fly
it will not do
it will soon blow over
it will take some doing
it won’t do
it won’t hurt
it works
it would take an act of congress to
it wouldn’t do any harm
it wouldn’t hurt
it's a deal

it’s no skin off his nose
it’s no skin off my nose
it’s no skin off your nose
it’s no use

it’s not brain surgery
it’s not day
it’s not my problem
it’s not over until the fat lady sings
it’s not rocket science

there’s many a slip ’twixt cup and lip
there’s method in madness
there’s more than one way to skin a cat
there’s no accounting for taste
there’s no comparison
there’s no fool like an old fool
there’s no getting away from
there’s no knowing
there’s no law against
there’s no peace for the wicked
there’s no rest for the wicked
there’s no rhyme or reason for
there’s no rhyme or reason to
there’s no saying
there’s no such thing as a free lunch
there’s no telling
there’s nothing like
there’s nothing to it
there’s one born every minute
there’s only one thing for it
there’s safety in numbers

you cannot put the same shoe on every foot
you cannot run with the hare and hunt with the hounds
you cannot serve god and mammon
you cannot teach an old dog new tricks
you cannot tell a book by its cover
you cannot unring a bell
you can’t be too careful
you can’t compare apples and oranges
you can’t get away from
you can’t go wrong
you can’t keep a good man down
you can’t make a silk purse out of a sow’s ear
you can’t make an omelette without breaking eggs
you can’t say fairer than that
you can’t take anywhere
you can’t talk
you can’t teach an old dog new tricks
you can’t win
you could cut it with a knife
you could cut the atmosphere with a knife
you could do worse than do
