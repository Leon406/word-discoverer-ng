he has been and done
he has made his bed
he hill
he is a regular trojan
he is going to kill
he is going to murder
he is not going to bite
he is not going to eat
he laughs best who laughs last
he laughs longest who laughs last
he laughs loudest who laughs last
he lives long who lives well
he looks a little peaked
he looks like a million
he made my day
he might be forgiven for
he needs to get our more
he or she
he puts his pants on one leg at a time
he puts his trousers on one leg at a time
he saved the day
he started it
he stoops to conquer
he takes it
he that cannot obey cannot command
he that hath a full purse never wanted a friend
he that is down need fear no fall
he that lieth with dogs riseth with fleas
he that would eat the fruit must climb the tree
he that would eat the kernel must crack the nut
he that would go to sea for pleasure would go to hell for a pastime
he that would have eggs must endure the cackling of hens
he that would the daughter win must with the mother first begin
he travels fastest who travels alone
he who begins many things finishes but few
he who excuses himself accuses himself
he who fails to prepare prepares to fail
he who fights and runs away may live to fight another day
he who gives fair words feeds you with an empty spoon
he who hesitates
he who laughs last laughs best
he who laughs last laughs longest
he who lives by the sword dies by the sword
he who pays the piper calls the tune
he who plays with fire gets burnt
he who rides a tiger is afraid to dismount
he who sleeps forgets his hunger
he who smelt it dealt it
he who sups with the devil should have a long spoon
he who would climb the ladder must begin at the bottom
he will be forgiven for
he will kill
he will murder
he would be forgiven for
he would be lucky

is at disposal
is at your disposal
is bag
is beyond me
is going to murder me
is going to murder you
is in business
is it just me
is not a bed of roses
is nothing sacred
is rotten in denmark
is that a fact
is that right
is that so
is there any truth to
is what it is
is your bag
isle of man
isle of wight
isn’t having any of it
issue a call for
issue forth from
issue from some place
issue her with
issue it to
it all boils down to
it all comes out in the wash
it all depends
it all together
it always pays
it appears to me
it beats me
it blows my mind
it cost an arm and a leg
it cost the earth
it could happen to a bishop
it cuts both ways
it cuts two ways
it dawned on sb
it do not make me no never mind
it does exactly what it says on the tin
it does heart good
it does no harm
it does what it says on the tin
it doesn’t grow on trees
it escapes
it figures
it gave me life
it goes to show
it goes with the territory
it goes without saying
it happens
it has your name on it
it is a long lane that has no turning
it is a long story
it is a matter of
it is a poor heart that never rejoices
it is a question of
it is a sad heart that never rejoices
it is a wise child that knows its own father
it is a wrap
it is all downhill
it is all over for
it is all over with her
it is all over with one
it is all up with
it is an ill wind that blows nobody good
it is better to be born lucky than rich
it is better to give than to receive
it is better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all
it is better to travel hopefully than to arrive
it is better to wear out than to rust out
it is business as usual
it is dogged that does it
it is easier to tear down than to build up
it is easy to be wise after the event
it is easy to find a stick to beat a dog
it is high time
it is just as well
it is just one of those things
it is meat and drink to me
it is more blessed to give than to receive
it is never too late
it is nice to meet you
it is nice to see you
it is no crime
it is no picnic
it is not over til it is over
it is not saying much
it is not worth it
it is not worth the trouble
it is nothing
it is six and two threes
it is the berries
it is the pace that kills
it is tipping down
it is tipping it down
it is to die
it is to laugh
it is touch and go
it is what it is
it is written all over face
it is you
it isn’t his thing
it isn’t my thing
it isn’t on
it makes no difference
it makes no odds
it me
it never fails
it never pays
it never rains but it pours
it occurs to me
it pays to
it phased me out
it remains to be seen
it says a lot about
it says a lot for
it says very little for
it seems to me
it serves right
it sounds like a plan
it speaks well for
it stands to reason
it strikes me
it sucks
it takes a thief to catch a thief
it takes a village
it takes all sorts
it takes getting used to
it takes money to make money
it takes one bad apple to spoil the bunch
it takes one to know one
it takes two
it was a lark
it was ever so
it was ever thus
it was fun while it lasted
it was greek to me
it was nice to see you
it was nothing
it was tipping down
it was tipping it down
it will all come out in the wash
it will be a cold day in hell
it will be ass
it will come out in the wash
it will cost her
it will cost you
it will never do
it will never fly
it will not do
it will soon blow over
it will take some doing
it won’t do
it won’t hurt
it works
it would take an act of congress to
it wouldn’t do any harm
it wouldn’t hurt
it's a deal

its a wonder that
its true color
itsy bitsy

it’ll be all right on the night
it’ll be alright on the night
it’s a fair cop
it’s a free country
it’s a long story
it’s a small world
it’s about time
it’s all greek to me
it’s all water under the bridge
it’s always the way
it’s an ill wind that blows nobody any good
it’s as broad as it’s long
it’s chucking it down
it’s early days
it’s high time
it’s just a matter of time
it’s no skin off his nose
it’s no skin off my nose
it’s no skin off your nose
it’s no use
it’s not as if
it’s not brain surgery
it’s not day
it’s not my problem
it’s not over until the fat lady sings
it’s not rocket science
it’s now or never
it’s only a matter of time
it’s six of one and half a dozen of the other
it’s still early days
it’s water under the bridge
it’s your funeral

ive had enough of this

you all
you and me
you and the horse you rode in on
you and whose army
you and yours
you are all over
you are more than welcome
you are never too old to learn
you are welcome
you are what you eat
you attract more flies with honey than vinegar
you be the judge of that
you beaut
you bet
you can bet on it
you can bet the farm
you can bet your boots
you can bet your bottom
you can bet your life
you can catch more flies with honey than with vinegar
you can catch more flies with honey than you can with vinegar
you can dispense with
you can do worse than do
you can have too much of a good thing
you can kiss goodbye
you can lead a horse to water
you can like it or lump it
you can never tell
you can run but you can’t hide
you can say that again
you can say that in spades
you can stuff
you can take a horse to water but you cannot make him drink
you can talk
you can thank your lucky stars
you can whistle for it
you cannot get a quart into a pint pot
you cannot get blood from a stone
you cannot have your cake and eat it
you cannot lose what you never had
you cannot make a crab walk straight
you cannot make an omelet without breaking eggs
you cannot please everyone
you cannot polish a turd
you cannot put a wise head on young shoulders
you cannot put an old head on young shoulders
you cannot put new wine in old bottles
you cannot put the same shoe on every foot
you cannot run with the hare and hunt with the hounds
you cannot serve god and mammon
you cannot teach an old dog new tricks
you cannot tell a book by its cover
you cannot unring a bell
you can’t be too careful
you can’t compare apples and oranges
you can’t get away from
you can’t go wrong
you can’t keep a good man down
you can’t make a silk purse out of a sow’s ear
you can’t make an omelette without breaking eggs
you can’t say fairer than that
you can’t take anywhere
you can’t talk
you can’t teach an old dog new tricks
you can’t win
you could cut it with a knife
you could cut the atmosphere with a knife
you could do worse than do
you could eat off the floor
you could have fooled me
you could have heard a pin drop
you could have knocked me down with a feather
you could hear a pin drop
you could not swing a cat
you could use
you crumb
you deal with it
you do the math
you do you
you don’t say
you dope
you first
you gals
you get what you pay for
you give up too easy
you got it
you got me beat
you got me there
you got to crack a few eggs to make an omelet
you got to do what you got to do
you gotta do what you gotta do
you guys
you had better believe it
you had me worried
you had one job
you had to be there
you had to have been there
you have got to be kidding
you have got to laugh
you have lost me
you have made your bed and must lie in it
you have made your bed and will have to lie on it
you have no idea
you have some explaining to do
you have to be cruel to be kind
you have to be good to be lucky
you have to break eggs to make an omelet
you have to do what you have to do
you have to eat a peck of dirt before you die
you have to hand it to
you haven’t lived
you heard
you heel
you know
you little beaut
you live and learn
you look marrrrvelous
you lot
you made my day
you make a better door than a window
you make a better door than you do a window
you make me laugh
you make me sick
you may as well
you mean to tell me
you might as well
you must be fun at parties
you must be joking
you must be kidding
you must be new here
you must be out of your mind
you must lose a fly to catch a trout
you name it
you need money to make money
you need to bait the hook to catch the fish
you never can tell
you never get a satisfied cock without a wet pussy
you never know
you never miss the water till the well runs dry
you never miss the water until the well runs dry
you owe it to to
you owe it to yourself to
you pay your money
you pays your money and takes your choice
you pays your money and you takes your choice
you put your foot in it
you reap what you sow
you reap whatsoever you sow
you said a mouthful
you said it
you scared me out of my wits
you scratch my back and i’ll scratch yours
