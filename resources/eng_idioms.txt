I ask you	
I beg your pardon	
I can hardly wait	I can’t wait
I can promise you	
I can tell you	
I can’t take anywhere	
I could eat a horse	
I could use	
I couldn’t give a monkey’s	
I dare say	
I don’t believe it	
I don’t blame her	
I don’t blame you	
I don’t give a monkey’s	
I don’t mind admitting

I tip my hat to	
I told you so	
I warrant you	
I would just as soon do	
I wouldn’t mind	
I wouldn’t put it past	
I wouldn’t say no	
Is that a fact	
It’s a long story
I’d like to think	
I’ll be bound	
I’ll be buggered	
I’ll be damned	
I’ll be darned	
I’ll be jiggered	
I’ll drink to that	
I’ll eat my hat	
I’ll give you that	
I’ll tell you what	
I’ll thank you for do	
I’ll warrant you	
I’m afraid	
I’m easy	
I’m glad to say	
I’m sorry to say	
I’m telling you	
I’ve only got one pair of hands
